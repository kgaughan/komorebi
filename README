stereochrome v2
===============

The code under here is meant to allow me to migrate to what I hope is a more
permanent setup for all my online stuff. Fundamentally, the project is to
deprecate stereochro.me as a website.

The project will be a partial port of my old PHP code over to a WSGI app of
some sort written in Python. Additionally, I'll be replacing the database
with SQLite, though I'm slightly worried about data corruption issues there.

The pages functionality is due to be replaced with a set of permanent
redirects to my blog. The linklog is probably going to be moved to
talideon.com/links, with permanent redirects forwarding there for linklog
entries, and posts redirecting to the weblog.

The output cache functionality will be replaced with Redis.
